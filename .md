# Train a model → Save it → Create API (Flask/FastAPI) → Host on AWS (EC2) with Docker

 STEP 1: Train & Save Your ML Model in Google Colab >>  Download the model file

Setep 2: Create a Flask API in VS Code


''' # Create a Virtual Environment

## Why Use Virtual Env in VS Code?
| Benefit                     | Why it Matters                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Isolation                | Keeps your project’s libraries separate from system/global Python       |
| 🎯 Clean dependencies       | Only installs what your project needs (not everything on your PC)       |
| ✅ Required for Docker later | You can export `requirements.txt` from it for Docker                    |
| 🔁 Reproducible             | Easy to share project with others — they can recreate exact environment |

python -m venv venv

# Activate venv 
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install  


pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test Your Flask API Locally
python app.py'''
